{This study is about the ability of agents to reason about the unrevealed mental content of other agents in competitive settings. This method of reasoning is called Theory of Mind and has been found to be effective in terms of social competence and competitive settings like negotiation. The study will focus on the Mod Game, a general sum n-player game where participants simultaneously choose a number from 1 to m each iteration to gain points, and will investigate the effect of Theory of Mind, coupled with signaling, on the emergent strategies and behavior in this game. The study will be conducted using virtual agents and by simulating two different versions of the Mod Game: one normal and the other one with signaling, where a part of agent population will be able to signal their chosen number to the other agents and the remaining agents will be able to receive and process these signals to make their decisions.\vspace{6ex}}
