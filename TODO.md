## THESIS


### Introduction

* [ ] (**OPTIONAL**) Add reasoning/reference for agent-based modeling (https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Agent-based%20computational%20models%20and%20generative%20social%20science&publication_year=1999&author=J.%20Epstein) and (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370213000441)

### Results

* [ ] Add explanation to results
    * [ ] Add explanation to results for the Signaling Simulation
        * [ ] Add explanation to results for the Second Order Over/Under Abundance
        * [ ] Add explanation results for signaling agents over/under abundance 70/30 
        * (**OPTIONAL**) [ ] Add explanation results for signaling agents over/under abundance 90/10
